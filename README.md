Write a fizzbuzz.cpp program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz.

```git
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
    ...
97
98
Fizz
Buzz
Happy coding!
